              Ask yourself this: what do you want from a sequel to The Legend of
              Zelda: Breath of the Wild? More enemy variety? Better dungeons?
              Totally unexpected new ideas? Or is simply more Hyrule to explore
              enough for you? Thankfully, you don’t have to pick just one,
              because Nintendo’s response to all of those answers is a casual
              but confident, “Sure thing.” The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the
              Kingdom doesn’t necessarily revolutionize what already made Breath
              of the Wild one of the greatest games of all time, but it’s not a
              sequel that’s simply more of the same, either. This sandbox is
              bigger, richer, and somehow even more ambitious, with creative new
              systems like vehicle building, ridiculous weapon crafting, and a
              revamped map with a dizzying amount of depth further fleshing out
              the intoxicating exploration that made the original so
              captivating. Breath of the Wild felt far from unfinished but,
              inconceivably, Tears of the Kingdom has somehow made it feel like
              a first draft.
            </p>
            <h2>Before we dive too deep into Hyrule</h2>
            <p>
              I won’t spoil the (actually pretty great) story Tears tells, but
              these games are about so much more than the plot. That magic the
              first time you see one of BotW’s dragons soaring overhead is
              around every corner here too, and the last thing I’d want to do is
              steal the many moments that made my jaw literally drop from you.
              That said, there are some huge parts of Tears that are introduced
              fairly early on that I will be talking about because of how
              fundamental they are to why this game is so impressive. I am going
              to preserve as much of the magic as I can but, if (like millions
              of others) you’ve already decided you are going to play Tears, you
              should probably just go play it and then come back to share in the
              wonder with me later.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterclass in
              open-world design and a watershed game that reinvents a
              30-year-old franchise. It presents a wonderful sandbox full of
              mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in
              front of you that just beg to be explored. I’ve had so many
              adventures in Breath of the Wild, and each one has a unique story
              behind what led me to them, making them stories on top of stories.
              And even after I’ve spent more than 50 hours searching the far
              reaches of Hyrule, I still manage to come across things I haven’t
              seen before. I’ll easily spend 50 to 100 more trying to track down
              its fascinating moments. - Jose Otero, March 2, 2017

        <h2>Score: 10</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The story stands out from your typical Zelda plots.</strong>
            - The bulk of the cutscenes and big story moments are also once
            again collected at specific spots around the map, shedding light on
            the history of Hyrule and the source of the “Upheaval” – a bombastic
            event at the start of Tears that opens up menacing chasms, causes
            the ruins of an ancient civilization called the Zonai to appear
            floating in the sky, and peppers the surface with new structures and
            strange anomalies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >This may be the same map, but it in no way feels
              repetitive.</strong
            >
            - While this is the same fundamental map of Hyrule, it in no way
            feels repetitive to explore – even as someone who’s scoured BotW for
            secrets. The story doesn’t give you a hard number, but it’s been a
            few years since the defeat of Calamity Ganon, and the people are
            rebuilding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Any doubt melted into pure, joyous amazement when I dove down my
              first chasm.</strong
            >
            - While roughly the same size as the surface, the Depths doesn’t
            have as much in the way of side quests or story moments but is full
            of treasure chests to seek out and plenty of surprises worth
            discovering for yourself, many of which are brilliantly hidden in
            plain (if very dark) sight.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >It's hard to overstate how big this game feels, even in the
              context of Breath of the Wild.</strong
            >
            - In 2017, I had played just over 80 hours of BotW when I finally
            decided to beat the final boss, feeling content that I had done all
            of the side quests, shrine hunting, and other odds and ends that I
            wanted to do. Not quite all that existed, mind you, but definitely a
            significant majority and certainly all of what really tempted me.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >The weapon fusion just says, "Yes" to whatever you throw at
              it.</strong
            >
            - That’s also true of the absolutely absurd new weapon fusion
            system, which lets you attach any item or object onto any other
            weapon, shield, and often even arrowhead.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >The building tools walk the line of powerful but approachable
              extremely well.</strong
            >
            - The complementary ability to weapon fusion is the boundlessly
            creative Ultra Hand building system. Essentially, BotW’s Magnesis
            power got a huge upgrade that now lets you pick up, rotate, and
            attach almost any object to another with ease.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >It's clear Nintendo was listening to feedback after BotW.</strong
            >
            - Your other two new abilities take a less prominent role, but they
            support the additions made elsewhere nicely. You can reverse time on
            objects with Recall, which is largely used either to ride rocks that
            have fallen from sky islands back up where they came from or to send
            an enemy attacks back at them in neat ways, while Ascend lets you
            warp through the ceiling up to whatever is above you.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Score: 10</h2>
        <p>
          The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is an unfathomable follow-up
          to one of the greatest games ever made, somehow improving upon it in
          nearly every way – be that with simple quality-of-life improvements, a
          genuinely exciting story, or wildly creative new building mechanics
          that make you rethink what is possible. It both revamps old ground and
          introduces vast new areas so immense it somehow makes me wonder if
          Breath of the Wild was actually all that big, with an almost alarming
          number of tasks to complete, mysteries to discover, and delightful
          distractions to keep you from ever reaching that place you naively
          thought you were headed. Nintendo has followed up a triumph with a
          triumph, expanding and evolving a world that already felt full beyond
          expectation and raising the bar ever higher into the clouds.

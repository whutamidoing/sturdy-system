            <p>
              When I gave Elden Ring a 10 two years ago, I did so not just
              because it’s an incredible game, but because it also raised the
              bar for open-world games as a whole. The way it encourages
              exploration, rewards curiosity, and challenges you to find your
              own individual solutions to difficult combat encounters by
              including tons of different viable weapons, spells, and other
              build options is absolutely exemplary. Now, FromSoftware is back
              to raise the bar on everyone yet again, this time when it comes to
              what you’d expect from a "simple" DLC.
            </p>
            <h2>According to our count, there are more than 40 bosses.</h2>
            <p>
              When you bring up the map, it may not seem like The Realm of
              Shadow is that big, but it is incredibly dense because it’s
              stacked in layers. Paths lead upwards toward ruins suspended in
              the sky, others delve deep beneath the surface, and some even pull
              you in directions you might not have believed you could even be
              pulled. You might find a hidden ladder tucked away in the far
              corner of a castle rampart, only to follow that trail for an hour
              before it eventually spills out into a totally new,
              otherwise-inaccessible area.
            </p>
            <p>
              But even with all of the discoveries to be made, I never felt lost
              or unsure of where I could or should go next. The main goal of
              this DLC is to follow the footsteps of the demigod Miquella, who
              left his flesh behind and fled to the Realm of Shadow. These
              footsteps are marked by large crosses that elegantly serve as
              subtle signposts to let you know when you’re in the vicinity of a
              plot-critical path, without it ever feeling like your hand is
              being held as you’re nudged in one explicit direction.

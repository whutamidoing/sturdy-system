              As a fan of Jujutsu Kaisen, Roblox Jujutsu Infinite is giving me
              the RPG experience I never imagined. Unlike many other JJK games,
              this is a no-nonsense adaptation of the popular animanga series.
              Here, you can build your character from scratch to become the
              ultimate sorcerer while the combat and visuals take you to the
              true imagination of the animation series. To help you in your RPG
              journey, we have compiled Jujutsu Infinite codes that give you
              free spins. Use these spins to get better traits and abilities to
              become the strongest mage in Jujutsu Infinite.
            </p>
            <h2>All New Jujutsu Infinite Codes</h2>

              If you are an end-game player and the Flame Arrow is not cutting
              it, you should get the FUGA Flame Chant. Since it trumps the arrow
              in terms of raw damage, you can easily take waves of enemies down
              in no time. Here's how to unlock FUGA Chant in Jujutsu Infinite.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can get the FUGA Chant in Jujutsu Infinite by completing the
              Frost Sorcerer's quest. To get the chant and finish the quest, you
              must obtain these items:
            </p>
            <p>
              Do note that you can use FUGA Flame Chant without a domain. Having
              said that, the heian awakening does the most damage when used
              within a domain, so make sure to obtain Domain Expansion first.
              Here's a step-by-step guide to unlocking the FUGA Chant in Jujutsu
              Infinite.

          You can expect a more comprehensive list of new features on the CK

            you need to press once you start the quest. The buttons are black
            and square and can be easily identified. Here's the location of
            every button:

              allows you to combine your forces in combat and simultaneously
              attack enemies, or split your party to each follow your own quests
              and agendas. Concoct the perfect plan together… or introduce an
              element of chaos when your friends least expect it. Relationships
              are complicated. Especially when you’ve got a parasite in your
              brain.

              7 unique Origin heroes offer a hand-crafted experience, each with
              their own unique traits, agenda, and outlook on the world. Their
              stories intersect with the overarching narrative, and your choices
              will determine whether those stories end in redemption, salvation,
              domination, or one of many other outcomes. Play as an Origin and
              enjoy their stories, or recruit them to fight alongside you.

              based on the D&amp;D 5e ruleset. Team-based initiative, advantage
              and disadvantage, and roll modifiers join an advanced AI, expanded
              environmental interactions, and a new fluidity in combat that
              rewards strategy and foresight. Three difficulty settings allow
              you to customise the challenge of combat. Enable weighted dice to
              help sway the battle, or play on Tactician mode for a hardcore
              experience.

              With the looming threat of war heading to Baldur’s Gate, and a
              mind flayer invasion on the horizon, friendships – though not
              necessary – are bound to be forged on your journey. What becomes
              of them is up to you, as you enter real, vibrant relationships
              with those you meet along the way. Each companion has their own
              moral compass and will react to the choices you make throughout
              your journey. At what cost will you stick to your ideals? Will you
              allow love to shape your actions? The relationships made on the
              road to Baldur’s Gate act as moments of respite at camp as much as
              they add weight to the many decisions you make on your adventure.

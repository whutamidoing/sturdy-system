              Silksong was originally conceived as downloadable content for
              Hollow Knight, but the scope of the project grew enough that Team
              Cherry announced it as a separate sequel in February 2019.
            </p>
            <h2>Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>
            <p>
              Hollow Knight: Silksong is a Metroidvania video game in
              development by Australian independent developer Team Cherry. The
              sequel to Hollow Knight, it is being developed for Linux, macOS,
              Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One,
              and Xbox Series X/S.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hollow Knight: Silksong gameplay is set to be similar to its
              predecessor Hollow Knight, featuring 2D platforming and combat.
              Some changes are made from the original, such as the player
              character moving with a more acrobatic flair or applying instant
              self-healing. Side-quests will be part of the game, and include a
              journal to keep track of them. This includes a quest system
              divided into four categories titled Gather, Wayfarer, Hunt, and
              Grand Hunt, which are provided by the non-player characters in the
              game or by quest boards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Team Cherry stated Silksong to be very large, featuring at least
              165 new enemies and over 100 different checkpoints ("benches")
              throughout the game world, compared to 41 in Hollow Knight.

        <h2>Premise</h2>
        <p>
          Hornet is captured and taken to the unknown kingdom of Pharloom, which
          is said to be "haunted by Silk and Song", and must climb to the top to
          reach a shining citadel.
        </p>
        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
          Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced on 14 February 2019 in a trailer
          and with a developer diary video sharing more information. Since the
          announcement, per GameSpot, "updates have been sporadic and
          infrequent".
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, due to the increased scope of the project, Team Cherry
          decided to expand the downloadable content to a full sequel.
        </p>
        <p>
          An article in PC Gamer from February 2022 showcased Team Cherry
          co-director William Pellen stating that the game was still in
          development despite the lack of updates since December 2019 and said
          that more details would be revealed as the game got closer to its
          release.
        </p>
        <h2>Reception</h2>
        <p>
          In May 2022, Hollow Knight: Silksong won a "Most Anticipated Game"
          award from Unity. In response, Team Cherry thanked the community for
          their support and said "It can't be too much longer, surely!" Silksong
          won the same award again in 2024, this time without any official
          acknowledgment.

              Final Fantasy XIV Online has quite the history despite its sudden
              growth in popularity. Initially released in 2010, it fell flat on
              its face before being re-released in the form of FFXIV: A Realm
              Reborn.

            </h2>
            <p>
              From there, the title has skyrocketed to fame thanks to the likes
              of Twitch streamers such as Asmongold, and in turn, has seen
              several successive expansions.
            </p>
            <p>
              That being said, here are all of the FFXIV expansions that have
              been released so far, along with the ones that haven’t. So strap
              in, since we’re going to cover every single adventure that Eorzea
              has to offer, from Heavensward to Endwalker.

              <strong>FFXIV: A Realm Reborn (2013/2014)</strong> - As we
              mentioned before, FFXIV has a long and winding history, but the
              game’s success truly began with its remake and re-release in 2013.
              Entitled “A Realm Reborn,” Eorzea received a new coat of paint, as
              well as an overhaul to tired mechanics.

              - Following the harrowing tale of the Millenium-long Dragonsong
              War, Heavensward sees the Warrior of Light take up refuge in the
              mysterious Ishgard. Looking to finally bring about peace between
              the dragons of Dravania and the Holy See of Ishgard, they uncover
              a conspiracy that shakes the city to its core. Heavensward’s story

              Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty (Polish: Cyberpunk 2077: Widmo
              Wolno≈õci) is a 2023 expansion pack for the 2020 video game
              Cyberpunk 2077 developed by CD Projekt RED. The expansion
              introduces a new district to the game's open world, as well as a
              new quest line.
            </p>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
              Cyberpunk 2077 is an action role-playing video game played from a
              first-person perspective. The story of the Phantom Liberty
              expansion is set in a new district named "Dogtown", which has its
              own unique characters, quests and gigs. Phantom Liberty introduces
              a new Relic skill tree with nine abilities. To unlock new Relic
              skills, players must progress the story of Phantom Liberty, or
              access restricted data terminals found in Dogtown. The DLC also
              raises the level cap to 60, and adds new weapons and vehicles into
              the game. New quickhacks are also added to the game, allowing
              players to perform actions such as air dashing, seeing through
              walls, or changing V's appearance on the fly. Vehicular combat is
              also added, allowing players to drive cars armed with missile
              launchers and machine guns. Depending on player's decision, a new
              ending for the base game will be unlocked. The tool is a
              stripped-down version of the editor that Bethesda's developers use
              to create the game and DLCs. It allows modders to create and edit
              almost all existing game objects including quests, items,
              locations and more. It's an incredibly powerful tool!

            <p>
              <strong>Setting and characters</strong> - Cyberpunk 2077 takes
              place in Night City, an American megacity in the Free State of
              North California, controlled by corporations and unassailed by the
              laws of both country and state. Players take on the role of
              Vincent / Valerie, also known as "V" (Gavin Drea / Cherami Leigh),
              a mercenary who was killed, then revived by an experimental
              Arasaka biochip called "the Relic", and ends up with a digitized
              engram of legendary rock star Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves)
              existing within their mind. Together, V and Johnny search for a
              way to prevent the Relic from killing the former and replacing
              their mind with Johnny's.

              <strong>Plot</strong> - Following a venture into the Pacifica
              district of Night City, the mercenary V is contacted by Song
              "Songbird" So Mi, the aide of NUSA President Rosalind Myers. She
              explains that their aircraft has been hacked and is about to crash
              in the lawless district of Dogtown, ruled by warlord Kurt Hansen.
              Songbird asks V to help rescue Myers in return for her assistance
              in preventing the Relic from destroying V's brain. V saves Myers
              and escorts her to a safehouse, but they lose contact with
              Songbird on the way.

              <strong>Development</strong> - Development of Phantom Liberty cost
              more than $60 million. In September 2022, CD Projekt Red confirmed
              that Phantom Liberty would be released for PC, Xbox Series X/S,
              and PlayStation 5 in 2023. In November 2022, it was confirmed that
              Phantom Liberty would be a paid expansion pack, akin to Witcher 3
              expansions Blood and Wine and Hearts of Stone. A trailer for
              Phantom Liberty was released during The Game Awards 2022 which
              revealed Idris Elba had joined the project. A release date of 26
              September 2023 for the Phantom Liberty expansion was revealed
              during the 2023 Xbox showcase as part of the Summer Game Fest.
              Pre-orders of Phantom Liberty grant the player a bonus in-game
              vehicle.

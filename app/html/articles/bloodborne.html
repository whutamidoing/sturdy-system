              FromSoftware is now established as one of the greatest AAA studios
              of our time, producing classic after classic under the inscrutable
              eye of director (and now company president) Hidetaka Miyazaki.
              Most of these games have found their way to PC. But the
              PlayStation 4 exclusive Bloodborne, which many including myself
              consider FromSoftware's masterpiece, remains locked to that
              platform.
            </p>
            <h2>
              Retired PlayStation exec reckons Bloodborne PC hasn't happened
              because Miyazaki 'cannot do it himself, but he doesn’t want anyone
              else to touch it'
            </h2>
            <p>
              In an interview with Kinda Funny Games (timestamp, and first
              spotted by Kotaku), Yoshida is asked about Bloodborne's future.
              "Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing, and people
              wonder why we haven’t really done anything like an update or
              remaster which should be easy," says Yoshida. "Sony’s known for
              doing so many remasters, right? And people get frustrated."
            </p>
            <p>
              Erm.. yeah? So where's the Bloodborne remaster or a sequel to one
              of the best-received first-party games Sony's ever had?
            </p>
            <p>
              "I have only my personal theory to that situation," says Yoshida.
              "I left first-party [Sony], so I don’t know what’s going on, but
              my theory is because I remember Miyazaki really, really loved
              Bloodborne, you know what he created and so I think he is
              interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy so he cannot
              do it himself, but he doesn’t want anyone else to touch it. So
              that’s my theory, and the PlayStation team respects his wish."
            </p>
            <p>
              Yoshida's at pains to emphasise that this is "my guess, my theory"
              and "I'm not revealing any secrets to be clear." Then, like the
              fleeting glimpses of hope scattered through Yharnam, the topic is
              gone.

        <h2>A Step by Step Full Guide to play Bloodborne on PC</h2>
        <p>How to play Bloodborne on PC</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Install the emulator - https://github.com/diegolix29/shadPS4</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You want the one that says qt in the link of your OS. eg win64-qt</p>
        <p>
          Go into properties of shadPS4.exe and check run as administrator and
          check disable full screen optimisation
        </p>
        <p>
          Make a games folder in the shadPS4 folder, Bloodborne folder inside
          the games folder, mods folder inside Bloodborne folder
        </p>
        <p>
          Open shadPS4.exe and set both paths to the games folder you just made
        </p>
        <p>
          Go into settings and change updates to 'Release' as it is more stable.
          Feel free to do 'Nightly' if you want. (In the latest version of the
          emulator V.0.6.1 the update channel has changed. Set to "Full-Souls"
          if "Release" isn't there)
        </p>
        <p>Change log type to 'sync'</p>
        <p>Switch to input tab and set cursor to 'always hidden'</p>
        <p>
          Switch to graphics tab and select your GPU, then set Vblank Divider to
          4
        </p>
        <p>Click apply then save</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Install the game. I cannot directly link anything in this post or in
            DM's. You'll have to search around. (AD Blocker Advised. I also ran
            a full scan on my PC, no viruses, nothing dodgy happening, my PC is
            working fine)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You want the one that says 'Bloodborne 1.09 DLC and Mods'. It will
          take roughly 1hr 45 mins because of throttled download (Update
          18/02/2025 - No longer available but if you can get the base game
          (GOTY) and a patch you are good)
        </p>
        <p>
          Once installed, click file in the shadPS4 emulator and then install
          packages (.PKG)
        </p>
        <p>
          Select the larger file first which says 'Bloodborne 1.09'. It will
          take a while to extract
        </p>
        <p>
          Once completed, install the other PKG that says ‘Version Fix 1.09'
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is an example of the files -
          https://imgur.com/a/bloodborne-pc-JfmwxGF
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Install these mods: Vertex Explosion Fix -
            https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/109?tab=files
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Jump on L3 (Optional) - https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/156
        </p>
        <p>
          Note - These mods are only here if you need them! You may not need any
          at all. Figure it out by trial and error
        </p>
        <p>Put all of these mods in the mod folder you created earlier</p>
        <p>
          Go into your games folder and there should be a folder called
          CUSA00900
        </p>
        <p>
          (Optional step) Copy and paste the dvdroot_ps4 folder for a backup
        </p>
        <p>
          Open each of your mods folders and copy the dvdroot_ps4 folder into
          the CUSA00900 folder
        </p>
        <p>
          For the RAM Spike mod you need to open the main dvdroot_ps4 folder
          then paste the mtd folder in
        </p>
        <p>
          Just in case anybody asks where they go here is an image guide for
          mods - https://imgur.com/a/image-guide-bloodborne-pc-R35IIzg
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Go back to the emulator and right click on Bloodborne then click
            cheats/patches
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Change to patches tab, change repository to shadPS4 then click
          download patches
        </p>
        <p>Check each of these: Skip Intro</p>
        <p>Disable Chromatic Aberration</p>
        <p>Disable Motion Blur</p>
        <p>Disable HTTP Requests</p>
        <p>60 FPS (With Deltatime)</p>
        <p>Disable vsync</p>
        <p>Resolution Patch 720p</p>
        <p>
          (I recommend 720p but you can go higher if you want or lower if
          needed)
        </p>
        <p>
          1440p or higher are quite choppy and have more issues but you can try
          to run it if you want
        </p>
        <p>Click save once you have checked all of these.</p>
        <p>
          You should now be able to play Bloodborne! Click the play button or
          double click on Bloodborne
        </p>
        <p>
          It won’t be perfect, you might get the odd crash here and there but it
          runs!
        </p>
        <p>
          If it says eboot.bin file not found, try restarting the emulator. If
          it crashes on startup you may need to downgrade the shadPS4 version
          (fresh install). I use an AMD setup and the latest version of shadPS4
          does not work. Currently for me it works on V.0.4.1
        </p>
        <p>
          V.0.4.1 was removed however I reuploaded it should anyone want/need it
          - https://github.com/CRIXSHWA/diegolix29s-shadPS4-V.0.4.1/releases
          (Windows Only)
